## Current Progress

We are currently gathering content from the **CV Practice Competition** (CV实践赛) as part of our club activities. The goal of this competition is to provide students with hands-on experience in solving real-world computer vision problems while encouraging collaboration, learning, and innovation in the AI field.

### CV Practice Competition (CV实践赛) - Goals & Purpose

The **CV Practice Competition** aims to:
- Offer students practical exposure to computer vision tasks and methodologies.
- Provide a collaborative environment where participants can learn from each other and improve their skills.
- Foster creativity in applying AI solutions to real-world problems.

### Recommended Practice Projects

Here are some of the recommended projects for the competition:
- **Pneumonia X-ray Classification**: Classify chest X-ray images to detect pneumonia.
- **Street View Road Segmentation**: Perform semantic segmentation to identify drivable areas in street view images.
- **Plant Disease Recognition**: Detect diseases in plant leaves through image classification.
- **Satellite Building Segmentation**: Segment buildings from satellite images for urban planning.
- **Retail Shelf Detection**: Detect products on retail shelves for inventory management.
- **Retinal Vessel Segmentation**: Segment blood vessels from retinal images for medical diagnosis.
- **Tomato Fruit Instance Segmentation**: Perform instance segmentation to detect and classify tomato fruits in agricultural images.

### Our Expectations

We hope that each participant:
- Will approach the competition with creativity and critical thinking, exploring unique AI solutions.
- Will contribute to the repository by sharing their project code, results, and documentation.
- Will collaborate and support each other in overcoming challenges and improving their models.
  
We are excited to see innovative work, and we encourage all students to push their boundaries while making significant strides in AI!
